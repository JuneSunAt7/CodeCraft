### 1. Defining the goal and requirements

- Improving efficiency

### 2. Data collection samples

- Use open source code sources like GitHub and find projects that have been actively refactored.

- Create your own datasets by refactoring several small projects manually.

### 3. Data preprocessing

- **Code Analysis**: Need to develop a parser for C++ code to extract syntactic information. 

- **Clang**: provides an API for parsing C++ code.

- ANTLR: you can use it to create parsers for programming languages.

### 4. Model selection and training

- **Model Selection**: You can choose from:

- **Machine Learning Models**: For example, LSTMs or Transformers for code generation.

- **Standard Rules**: Create a set of rules to be used for refactoring.

- **Model training**: For deep learning models, collect a training sample that includes pairs (code before refactoring, code after refactoring).

### 5. Tool Development

- **UI/Integration**: Develop a user interface or plugin for an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or others) that will use your model to refactor code.

- **Main Functions**:

- Code input (loading C++ project files)

- Analyzing and deriving improvements

- Applying refactoring to code

- Ability to view changes

### 6. Testing and evaluation

- **Testing**: Test your model on different datasets to see if the proposed changes improve code quality.

- **Evaluation**: Use metrics to evaluate the quality of the refactoring (e.g., readability, complexity, execution speed, etc.).

### 7. Documentation and Support

- **Documentation**: Write documentation for users of your tool explaining how to use it and what features it provides.

- **Support**: Consider creating a feedback system for users so that your system can improve based on feedback.

### Useful libraries and tools

- **ast**: To perform syntax tree analysis (in Python).

- **mypy**: For analyzing static code typing in Python.

- **black or autopep8**: For example, for formatting Python code, which can be useful for understanding refactoring principles.

- **clang**: For analyzing and processing C++ code.
